# cintel-06-custom

Objectives
This module gives you a chance to add a unique interactive app to your online portfolio. 

You should have already created a project repo named cintel-06-custom with 4 files: 

README.md
.gitignore
requirements.txt
app.py (OR dashboard/app.py if working locally and deploying to GitHub pages - see more below).
If you decide to try the local development, you'll be able to deploy your live date site using GitHub Pages. To make it easy to build our app from a folder and export the app into the docs folder (for Pages), please move your app.py file into a folder. I named my folder "dashboard", so I have a dashboard/app.py file and no app.py in the root folder. This is a more common organization for Python projects. 

You may develop your app in the browser (recommended if you have NOT had 44-608) or develop your app on your machine locally (recommended if you have had 44-608 and/or prior practice with project virtual environments). 

Your app.py or dashboard/app.py file should have the following sections:

imports (at the top)
define a reactive calc to fake new data points and/or filter a data frame
define the Shiny Express UI
The overall page options
A sidebar
The main section with ui cards, value boxes, and space for grids and charts
Your app should have a data source and sketched out the basic functionality before you begin.
